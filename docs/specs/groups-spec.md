## 1.0 Overview

This document outlines the technical design for the group management functionality. The system will allow users to create groups, manage memberships, and handle roles and permissions. The core of this system will be a relational model in Supabase, centered around a `groups` table and a `group_members` junction table.

Complex, transactional operations like group creation or an admin leaving a group will be encapsulated in **Supabase Database Functions (RPCs)**. This ensures that multi-step actions are performed atomically, maintaining data integrity and simplifying client-side logic. ü§ù

## 2.0 Data Model

To manage the many-to-many relationship between users and groups, and to store membership metadata, two primary tables will be created.

### 2.1 `groups` Table

This table stores the basic information for each group.

| Column | Type | Constraints & Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`id`** | `UUID` | **Primary Key.** |
| **`name`** | `TEXT` | The display name of the group. |
| **`created_by`** | `UUID` | **Foreign Key** to `auth.users.id`. Tracks the original founder. |
| **`created_at`**| `TIMESTAMPTZ`| Automatically set on creation. |

### 2.2 `group_members` Table

This is a **junction table** that links users to groups and defines their role and status within that group. It is the cornerstone of our group management logic.

| Column | Type | Constraints & Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`group_id`** | `UUID` | **Composite Primary Key**, **Foreign Key** to `groups.id`. |
| **`user_id`** | `UUID` | **Composite Primary Key**, **Foreign Key** to `profiles.id`. |
| **`role`** | `group_role` | **ENUM Type** with values: `'admin'`, `'member'`. |
| **`status`** | `member_status`| **ENUM Type** with values: `'active'`, `'inactive'`. Implements the "Frozen" state. |
| **`joined_at`** | `TIMESTAMPTZ`| Automatically set on insertion. |
| **`left_at`** | `TIMESTAMPTZ`| Nullable. Set when a user's status becomes `'inactive'`. |



### 2.3 `invites` Table

This table will manage pending invitations to join a group.

| Column | Type | Constraints & Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`id`** | `UUID` | **Primary Key**. |
| **`group_id`** | `UUID` | **Foreign Key** to `groups.id`. |
| **`inviter_id`**| `UUID` | **Foreign Key** to `profiles.id`. The user who sent the invite. |
| **`invitee_email`**| `TEXT` | The email address of the person being invited. |
| **`status`** | `invite_status`| **ENUM Type** with values: `'pending'`, `'accepted'`, `'declined'`. |
| **`created_at`**| `TIMESTAMPTZ`| Automatically set on creation. |

## 3.0 Core Group Operations & Flows

### 3.1 Group Creation (FR 3.2.1)

Creating a group requires two inserts (`groups` and `group_members`) that must succeed or fail together.
* **Mechanism:** This will be implemented as a single **Supabase Database Function (RPC)** named `create_group`.
* **Flow:**
    1.  The client calls the `create_group` function, passing the desired `group_name` and the creator's `user_id` (from their auth token).
    2.  The function starts a transaction.
    3.  It inserts a new row into the `groups` table.
    4.  It inserts a new row into the `group_members` table, linking the new group to the creator, assigning them the `'admin'` role and `'active'` status.
    5.  The transaction is committed.

### 3.2 Leaving a Group & Member Removal (FR 3.2.3, 3.2.4, 3.2.6)

To preserve transaction history, members are never deleted from a group. Instead, their status is changed.
* **Mechanism:** This is an `UPDATE` operation on the `group_members` table.
* **Flow:** When a user leaves or is removed, their `status` in the `group_members` table is updated from `'active'` to `'inactive'`, and the `left_at` field is populated.
* **"Frozen" State:** This `'inactive'` status is the technical implementation of the "frozen" member state. Other parts of the application (like creating a new expense) will filter for members `WHERE status = 'active'`, automatically excluding inactive members from new activities.

### 3.3 Admin Transfer on Departure (FR 3.2.5)

This critical workflow ensures a group is never left without an admin.
* **Mechanism:** A **Supabase Database Function (RPC)** named `transfer_admin_and_leave`.
* **Flow:**
    1.  The React frontend will enforce the selection of a new admin before allowing the current admin to initiate the leave action.
    2.  The client calls the RPC with `group_id`, `new_admin_id`, and the current admin's `user_id`.
    3.  The function executes a transaction to:
        a.  Update the `role` of the `new_admin_id` to `'admin'`.
        b.  Update the `status` of the current admin to `'inactive'`.

### 3.4 Member Invitations (FR 3.2.2)

This flow outlines how a user is invited to a group and how they join.

*   **Mechanism:** An existing group member initiates an invitation by providing an email address. This action calls a dedicated **Supabase Database Function (RPC)** named `invite_user`, which leverages Supabase's admin privileges.
*   **Flow:**
    1.  An active member of a group submits an email address through the "Invite Member" form in the UI.
    2.  The client calls the `invite_user` RPC, passing the `group_id` and `invitee_email`.
    3.  The `invite_user` function, running with elevated privileges on the backend, performs several actions:
        a. It calls `supabase.auth.admin.inviteUserByEmail()`, which generates and sends an official Supabase invitation email to the `invitee_email`.
        b. It inserts a new row into the `public.invites` table to track the pending invitation.
        c. It checks if a user exists with the provided email. If so, it also inserts a new row into the `public.notifications` table with a type of `'group_invite'` for the existing user.
    4.  The invited person clicks the link in the email.
    5.  Supabase handles the token exchange. If the user is new, they will be prompted to create a password to complete their account. If they are an existing user, they will be logged in.
    6.  The frontend, upon detecting a logged-in user, will check for any `'pending'` invites associated with their email and automatically call the `accept_invite` RPC to add them to the group.

## 4.0 Technical Implementation Details

### 4.1 Frontend (TypeScript-React)

* **Data Fetching:** The client will fetch a user's groups by querying the `group_members` table for their `user_id`, then joining with the `groups` table to get group names.
*   **UI Logic for "Previous Groups/Members" (FR 3.2.7):** The client will fetch all associated groups/members and then filter them into two lists for display based on the `status` field (`'active'` vs. `'inactive'`). Members with an `'inactive'` status will appear in the "Previous Members" tab.

### 4.2 Backend (Supabase RPCs)

The use of database functions is central to this design. It moves transactional logic to the database layer, ensuring atomicity and providing a simple, secure API for the client to call. Key RPCs will include `create_group`, `accept_invite`, and `transfer_admin_and_leave`.

## 5.0 Authorization (Supabase RLS)

For the initial MVP and internal testing phase, Row Level Security (RLS) policies will be simplified to accelerate development.

* **General Policy:** All policies on the `groups` and `group_members` tables will be relaxed. Instead of enforcing granular, role-based permissions, the policies will primarily check if a user is authenticated.
* **Implementation:**
    * **`SELECT` / `INSERT` / `UPDATE`:** The RLS policy for all operations on group-related tables will be a simple check for `auth.role() = 'authenticated'`. This allows any logged-in user to see, create, and modify any group or membership record.
* **Future State:** This simplified security model is temporary. Before production, these policies will be replaced with strict rules that ensure users can only access their own groups and that only admins can perform sensitive actions. üîí
